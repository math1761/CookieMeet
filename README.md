Cookie Meet

Cookie Meet is an API which can calculate the distance between multiples adresses, find the nearest users and contact him. We are using OAuth2 to propulse the API. Users can add a dish and the result will be displayed in the user details. 
To sum it simply, the goal of Cookie Meet would be to become a service between people who want to order food and people who want to sell their foods.
